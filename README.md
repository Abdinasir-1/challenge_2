# challenge_2
# What was the Challenge
The Challenge was to run an application on Docker container using two seperate containers to run a flask-app and a sql database
# How I expect the Challenge to go
I expected it to be difficult however I overcame certain adverseries in the challenge
# What went well?
I think the demos prepared me very well for this task which was a success from last week's challenge and the improvements have been taken on board. I understood all the commands required for the task which was a success. In addition I took the initative to solve errors I that have popped up in the virtual Machine. I believe my confidence and knowledge base is growing which is a good sign. I've encountered 3 errors today and only one of the was solved via the aide of Ben. I have made a note of the errors and written a description of where I went wrong.
# What didn't go as planned?
I believe the question wasn't specific enough for my understanding I only pick up on that I had to create a network between the two containers after having discussions with Ben. I also believe I could rearrange meetings scheduled for the day after 3pm as they interrupted my challenge task timing. That will something I need to work until I get my speed up.
# Possible improvement for future challenges
To request for specific information regarding the task of the challenge without giving the task away. Work on my time management in regards to the task and try to rearrange meetings for after submission time and I've taken the same amount of time to complete this time with the time spent in the meetings. As networking was one of the task that I have missed from the first challenge I think I need to revist that module and understand where I should place it in the code/command section.
